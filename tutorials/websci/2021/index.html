				<h2>Tutorial information</h2>

				<p>Bullying, once limited to physical spaces (e.g., schools, workplaces or sports fields) and particular times of the day (e.g., school hours), can now occur anytime, anywhere. Cyberbullying can take many forms; however, it typically refers to repeated and hostile behavior performed in an effort to intentionally and repeatedly harass or harm individuals. The consequences of cyberbullying can be devastating.</p>

				<p>The primary motivation of this tutorial is to provide a systematic overview of the state–of–the–art computational approaches for the detection, quantification, and mitigation of cyberbullying behavior in online social media. The goal is threefold:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Discuss and clarify the notion of cyberbullying, and the related nomenclature, by drawing from the social and psychological sciences.</li>
					<li>Summarize the progress of the WebSci community on an emerging research area with a growing body of research and plenty of open questions, both for researchers and practitioners.</li>
					<li>Identify challenges associated with understanding, predicting, and preventing cyberbulling behavior.</li>
					<li>Discuss opportunities for future research directions</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Throughout the tutorial, we highlight the open challenges that need to be addressed in understanding, predicting, and preventing cyberbullying behavior, as well as promising research directions for researchers interested in this area.</p>

				<p>The tutorial will be held as part of the <a href="https://websci21.webscience.org/" target="_blank">13th ACM Web Science Conference</a> on June 21st, 2021. A previous version of the tutorial was delivered at <a href="http://icwsm.org/2018" target="_blank">ICWSM</a> in Stanford, California, USA on June 25th, 2018. Relevant materials can be found <a href="./../../../icwsm2018tutorial/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

				<h2>Who should attend</h2>

				<p>This tutorial targets academic, industry and government researchers and practitioners with interest in user behavior modeling, social media and social network analysis, graph mining, and detection and prediction algorithms. Beginners will learn the basics of state–of–the–art methods in this area, whereas experts in the area will have a chance for an in–depth review of both platform–specific techniques and platform–independent algorithms to detect online bullying behavior. As a result, this tutorial should appeal to researchers of several disciplines.</p>
